## Wall-and-chamber decomposition movable cone Hilb^n(K3)

A SageMath script to explicitly compute the decomposition into KÃ¤hler-type chambers of the movable cone of the Hilbert scheme of points on a very general K3 surface.

The script has been used for computing examples in the papers:

[Automorphisms of Hilbert schemes of points on a generic projective K3 surface](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.05682), by A. Cattaneo;

[On birational transformations of Hilbert schemes of points on K3 surfaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.05187), by P. Beri and A. Cattaneo.
